# Spatial_Solow_Swan
FlexPDE Code for the simulation of spikes of Solow model.

See https://www.pdesolutions.com/ to download Flexpde7. Student Version is enough to do the simulation. 


This is the code used for the simulation of the paper "Boundary and interior spikes in economic agglomeration of a spatial Solow model with capital-induced labor migration".
